        <p>Rafael found a new hobbie: to draw using keyboard characters. Even this new kind of art being simple and limited, creativity is enough to make some really cool kind of drawings.</p>

        <p>After making a few drawings, Rafael wondered how they would be if they were resized, but having to remake all the drawing looked kind of tiring. For that, he asked your help.</p>

        <p>When you want to resize something, one image of <strong>N</strong> lines and <strong>M</strong> columns will have <strong>A</strong> lines and <strong>B</strong> columns, and, given that the new dimensions are bigger than the dimensions of the original image, some characters will have to repeat itself.</p>

        <p>Let's say that <strong>A</strong> is 3 times bigger than <strong>N</strong>. In this case, each line will have to repeat 3 times, so the image is resized correctly.</p>

        <p>Given a drawing made by Rafael, print how the drawing would be if it was resized to a new given dimension.</p>

    <h2>Input</h2>

    <div class="input">
        <p>There will be several test cases. Each test case starts with two integers <strong>N</strong> and <strong>M</strong> (1 ≤ <strong>N</strong>, <strong>M</strong> ≤ 50), representing, repectively, the height and the width of Rafael's drawing.</p>

        <p>Following there will be <strong>N</strong> lines, each containing <strong>M</strong> characters, representing the drawing made by Rafael. After, there will be two integers <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> (<strong>N</strong> &lt; <strong>A</strong> ≤ 100, <strong>M</strong> &lt; <strong>B</strong> ≤ 100, <strong>A</strong> is multiple of <strong>N</strong>, and <strong>B</strong> is multiple of <strong>M</strong>), representing, repectively, the new height and width that Rafael wants his drawing to have.</p>

        <p>The last test case is indicated when <strong>N</strong> = <strong>M</strong> = 0, which should not be processed.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Output</h2>

    <div class="output">
        <p>For each test case, print <strong>A</strong> lines, containing <strong>B</strong> characters each, representing the resized Rafael's drawing.</p>

        <p>After each test case, print one blank line.</p>
