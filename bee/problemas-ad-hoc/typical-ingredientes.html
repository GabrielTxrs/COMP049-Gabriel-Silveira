        <p>The northern region of Brazil is home to a very rich and creative culinary. With typical ingredients, unique spices, peculiar combinations and preparation methods, the dishes of the region always enchant the residents and tourists.</p>

        <p>In this culinary there are two kinds of ingredients: ingredients typical from the North, and ingredients common to the rest of the country. A portion is a mix of ingredients (typical and/or commons) and/or other portions, and is only considered typical if more than half of its components are typical.</p>

        <p>Rafael is visiting the North for the first time, and after a few meals he is very pleased with the local gastronomy. He realized that the more typical components a portion has, the more he is surprised by the taste.</p>

        <p>After taking some notes, Rafael asked for your help: Given the list of typical ingredients, and a list of several portions, you must tell which of these portions are typical.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Input</h2>

    <div class="input">
        <p>The input starts with an integer <strong>N</strong>, indicating how many typical ingredients there are (1 &lt;= <strong>N</strong> &lt;= 50). Following there will be <strong>N</strong> names, representing the <strong>N</strong>&nbsp;typical ingredients of the region.</p>

        <p>Following there will be an integer <strong>M</strong>, indicating how many portions should be analysed (1 &lt;= <strong>M</strong> &lt;= 100).</p>

        <p>
            Following there will be <strong>M</strong> input sets, each representing a portion.<br />
            Each of these sets starts with a name <strong>Si</strong> and a number <strong>Ki</strong>, representing the name of a portion and the amount of components (typical, common or portions) that make up this portion (1 &lt;= <strong>Ki</strong> &lt;= 50).<br />
            Following there will be <strong>Ki</strong> names, representing the components of this portion <strong>Si</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>The names of all the components are composed of only letters from the alphabet (uppercase or lowercase) and hyphen, and will have at most 50 characters.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Output</h2>

    <div class="output">
        <p>For each portion you should print one row with the phrase "porcao tipica" if the portion is typical, or "porcao comum" if the portion is not typical.</p>
